# VRCFaceTracking-blender-plugin
Creates blendshapes in Blender to be used for VRC FaceTracking

this is a forked version that is abit more extended/ reworked abit for funsies :D

# planned future update:
- redo some small bits of the lists such as replacing sad with frown since its supported on more headsets compared to sad (i think) (100%)
- custom user lists that're saved across sessions to allow creators to make, edit & share their own lists (basically custom import & export lists) (40%)
- a button to automatically create 4 or at least 2 Vertex groups to split the left and right side of face to make it easier to take the unsplit keys and split them (0%)
- a button to automatically take left and right vertex groups and split unsplit keys (100%)
- (a beta feature) a button for complete automatic FT setup making the entire process become very easy for newer creators! (unsure how well this'd work! so it will just be tested for abit) (35%)
- settings tab for things such as: removeal of buttons that you dont want to see since you wont use them (for the people who wanna keep things minimal) (69%)

# quick fyi

im currently busy with a bunch o' stuff! im aware that some may want some of these future planned updates sooner but ***please*** dont come into my dms to spam, harass, threaten, etc
that behaviour will just make me not want to work on this any further and even detach from the VRCFT community entirely, its not fun to have alot of interactions from it being like that.

hope you understand & hope you enjoy this silly lil fork :)

this will try to stay up to date with: https://docs.vrcft.io/docs/tutorial-avatars/tutorial-avatars-extras/unified-blendshapes
