# VRCFaceTracking-blender-plugin
Creates blendshapes in Blender to be used for VRC FaceTracking

this is a forked version that is abit more extended/ reworked abit for funsies :D

# Future Update Plans:
- redo some small bits of the lists such as replacing sad with frown since its supported on more headsets compared to sad (i think) (100%)
- custom user lists that're saved across sessions to allow creators to make, edit & share their own lists (basically custom import & export lists) (40%)
- a button to automatically create 4 or at least 2 Vertex groups to split the left and right side of face to make it easier to take the unsplit keys and split them (0%)
- a button to automatically take left and right vertex groups and split unsplit keys (100%)
- (a beta feature) a button for complete automatic FT setup making the entire process become very easy for newer creators! (unsure how well this'd work! so it will just be tested for abit) (35%)
- settings tab for things such as: removeal of buttons that you dont want to see since you wont use them (for the people who wanna keep things minimal) (69%)
- various other QOL things (0%)

# no longer working on this.. for now at least

i dont like people coming into my dms to harass me, its very demotivating and just makes me rather work on anything else instead

to anyone using my fork of this addon i hope you enjoy it and have fun!
perhaps in the future i will gain the motivation to work on this again but for the time being its just gonna be how it is ig :D
